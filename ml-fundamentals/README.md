# ML Fundamentals

This section covers classical machine learning models applied to workforce analytics.

## Projects
- **Regression Models**: Linear, Logistic, Regularized.
- **Tree-based Models**: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, CatBoost).
- **Model Evaluation**: RMSE, MAE, AUC, Feature Importance.

## Purpose
These projects demonstrate core ML skills and provide baselines before advancing into deep learning and LLMs.
