# AI & LLM Portfolio – Shizar Zarbafian

Welcome to my AI & LLM Engineering portfolio.  
This repository demonstrates end-to-end projects in **machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and large language models (LLMs)**.  
The projects showcase my transition from **Business Intelligence & Data Science** into **AI/LLM Engineering** by applying industry-grade methods, tools, and deployment practices.

\[
\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \eta \cdot \nabla_\theta J(\theta)
\]

- **Attention Mechanism**  
\[
\text{Attention}(Q,K,V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
\]

- **Error Metrics**  
RMSE, MAE, AUC, Concordance Index.
